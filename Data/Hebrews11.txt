Hebrews11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
Hebrews11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good testimony.
Hebrews11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.
Hebrews11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.
