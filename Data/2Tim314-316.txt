2Timothy3:14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,  
2Timothy3:15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2Timothy3:16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
